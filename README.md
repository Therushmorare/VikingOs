## 📜 About

**VikingOs** is a personal project where I attempt to build my own Linux-like operating system from scratch using **C** (and some **Assembly**).  
I'm still learning and experimenting — I have strong theoretical knowledge about OS architecture and this project helps turn that into real, practical experience.

Mistakes will happen. That's part of the journey! 🚀

## 🛠️ Goals

- [x] Set up project structure
- [ ] Create a basic bootloader
- [ ] Implement kernel initialization
- [ ] Set up memory management
- [ ] Create basic process management
- [ ] Build a simple file system
- [ ] Write drivers for basic hardware communication

## 🚀 How to Build and Run

### Requirements
- **GCC** (cross-compiler for x86)
- **NASM** (assembler)
- **QEMU** (or Bochs emulator)
- **Make**

### Commands
```bash
make
make run
    ⚠️ Note: VikingOs is in early experimental stages — unstable features and incomplete functionality should be expected.

🛤️ Roadmap

[ Bootloader ] ➡️ [ Kernel Initialization ] ➡️ [ Memory Management ] ➡️ [ Process Management ] ➡️ [ File System ] ➡️ [ Drivers ]
